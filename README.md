🚀 Advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning

📌 Project Title  
Real-time Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI)

🔍 Problem Statement  
Traditional IDS tools struggle to detect evolving attack vectors and zero-day threats. This project develops an intelligent, real-time intrusion detection system that uses machine learning and explainable AI (SHAP) to detect malicious activity from network and behavior-based data.

🌟 Why This Matters (Impact)

| Use Case              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Threat Detection      | Detect known and unknown cyberattacks across systems and networks          |
| SOC Automation        | Reduce false positives and analyst fatigue in Security Operations Centers  |
| Zero-day Mitigation   | Identify anomalies never seen before                                        |
| Forensic Analysis     | Enable deep explainability via SHAP to audit why attacks are flagged       |
| Security Enhancement  | Bolster enterprise security posture with adaptive learning mechanisms      |
